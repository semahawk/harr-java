% Rawr! testing. It's acting quite like print.
% It's not actually appending '!' to every string, though..

% Printing ordinary string
rawr("Ahoy!")
% => Ahoy!

% Printing numbers
rawr(3 + 2)
% => 5

% Printing contatented strings
rawr("Ahoy" + ", Sea!")
% => Ahoy, Sea!

% print w/ multiple arguments
rawr("Here be", "a line break!")
% => Here be
% => a line break!
